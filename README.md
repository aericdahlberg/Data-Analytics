Retail Sales Data Analysis — Tableau Dashboards
Professional Summary:
This project demonstrates my ability to translate raw retail sales data into clear, actionable business insights using Tableau. By combining strong analytical skills with data visualization expertise, I built a series of dashboards that highlight trends in product demand, customer demographics, sales performance, and cost analysis. These visuals are designed to help business leaders quickly identify opportunities for growth, optimize inventory strategies, and understand customer behavior across multiple channels.

Project Overview
The dashboards explore:

Product demand by hub and month

Sales distribution across retailers

Customer demographics

Buyer type performance

Month-over-month sales vs. inventory cost

The goal of this project was to transform raw retail data into clear, actionable insights for business decision-making.
